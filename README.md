   Question No.   | Question
:---------------:| -------------
   [Ques 1](QUES&#32;1)        | Write a Program to create a SET A and determine the cardinality of SET for an input array of elements (repetition allowed) and perform the following operations on the SET:<br/>a) ismember (a, A): checkwhether an element belongs to set or not and return value as true/false.<br/>b) powerset(A): list all the elements of power set of A.
   [Ques 2](QUES&#32;2)        | Create  a  class  SET  andtake  two  sets  as  input  from  user  to perform following  SET Operations:<br/>a) Subset: Check whether one set is a subset of other or not.<br/>b) Unionand Intersection of two Sets.<br/>c) Complement: Assume Universal Set as per the input elements from the user.<br/>d) Set Differenceand Symmetric Difference between two SETS.<br/>e) Cartesian Productof Sets.
   [Ques 3](QUES&#32;3)        | Create a class RELATION, use Matrix notation to represent a relation. Include functions to check if a relation is reflexive, Symmetric, Anti-symmetric and Transitive. Write a Programto use this class.
   [Ques 4](QUES&#32;4)        | Use the functions defined in Ques 3 to find check whether the given relation is:<br/>a) Equivalent, or<br/>b) Partial Order relation, or<br/>c) None
   [Ques 5](QUES&#32;5)        | Write a Program to generate the Fibonacci Series using recursion.
   [Ques 6](QUES&#32;6)        | Write a Program to implement Tower of Hanoi using recursion.
   [Ques 7](QUES&#32;7)        | Write a Program to implement binary search using recursion.
   [Ques 8](QUES&#32;8)        | Write a Program to implement Bubble Sort. Find the number of comparisons during each pass and display the intermediate result.Use the observed values to plot a graph to analyse the complexity of algorithm.
   [Ques 9](QUES&#32;9)        | Write a Program to implement Insertion Sort. Find the number of comparisons during each pass and display the intermediate result. Use the observedvalues to plot a graphto analyse the complexity of algorithm.
   [Ques 10](QUES&#32;10)       | Write a Program that generates all the permutations of a given set of digits, with or without repetition. (For example, if the given set is {1,2}, the permutations are 12 and 21). (One method is given in Liu)
   [Ques 11](QUES&#32;11)       | Write a Program to calculate Permutation and Combination for an input value nand r using recursive formula of  nCr and nPr.
   [Ques 12](QUES&#32;12)       | For any number n, write a program to list all the solutions of the equation x1 + x2 + x3 + ...+ xn=  C,  where  C  is  a  constant  (C<=10)  and x1,  x2,x3,...,xn are  non-negative  integers using  brute force strategy.
   [Ques 13](QUES&#32;13)       | Write a Programto accept the truth values of variables x and y, and print the truth table of the following logical operations:<br/>a) Conjunction&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;f) Exclusive NOR<br/>b) Disjunction&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; g) Negation<br/>c) Exclusive OR&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;h) NAND<br/>d) Conditional &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;i) NOR<br/>e) Bi-conditional
   [Ques 14](QUES&#32;14)       | Write a program to accept an input nfrom the user and graphically represent the valuesof T(n) where n varies from 0 to n for the recurrence relations. For e.g. T(n) = T(n-1) + n, T(0) = 1, T(n) = T(n-1) + n^2, T(0) =1, T(n) = 2*T(n)/2 + n, T(1)=1.
   [Ques 15](QUES&#32;15)       | Write  a  Program to  store  a  function  (polynomial/exponential), and  then  evaluate  the polynomial. (For example store f(x) = 4n^3+ 2n + 9 in an array and for a given value of n, say n = 5, evaluate (i.e. compute the value of f(5)).
   [Ques 16](QUES&#32;16)       | Write  a  Program to  represent  Graphs  using  the  Adjacency  Matrices  and  check  if  it  is  a complete graph.
   [Ques 17](QUES&#32;17)       | Write a Program to accept a directed graph G and compute the in-degree and out-degree of each vertex.
   [Ques 18](QUES&#32;18)       | Given a  graph  G, Write  a  Program to  find  the  number  of  paths  of  length nbetween  the source and destination entered by the user.
   [Ques 19](QUES&#32;19)       | Given  an  adjacency  matrix  of  a  graph,  write  a  program  to check  whether  a  given  set  of vertices {v1, v2, v3....., vk} forms an Euler path/ Euler Circuit (for circuit assume vk=v1).
   [Ques 20](QUES&#32;20)       | Given a full m-ary tree with iinternal vertices, Write a Program to find the number of leaf nodes.

It also contain some of the random practice questions.
